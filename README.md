## MHST2-Dex

A PokÃ©dex-like React app for showing monster information for the **Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin** game.

> This repository is mainly used as a matter to teach myself the basics of React, so please don't take this project too seriously.
> I'm just doing this for fun and for myself.


### This project uses devcontainers!

If you are using the glorious VSCode, you can simply run `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container...` and you're good to go with a development environment.


### How to run

I'm not really sure if I'm really going to develop a barebones backend in this repository as a monorepo, but you can simply run a `npm run web` (or similar scripts that you can find in the `package.json`) after cd'ing inside the `web` folder.


### Roadmap

- [] List of all monsters on the main page
- [] Self host of all resources
- [] Search bar for quick-access to specific monsters
- [] Decent styling
- [] Publish this app somewhere with a proper CI
